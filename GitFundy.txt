\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Git/GitHub Fundamentals:\
\
10/18/2018\
\

\b0 Distributed, source control system\
Fast, can work disconnected, 
\b branching, 
\b0 \
\
Disadvantages: It\'92s different > multiple local levels and a remote (traditional > 1 working copy > pushed to main)\
Best from command line\
Large binary files are an issue with GIT (?)\
\
What is 
\b GitHub
\b0 ? > Hosting service for GIT repositories > runs on top of GIT, adds extra services\
\

\b Base Concepts of GIT:\

\b0 Distributed (vs Centralized source control)\
\

\b Centralized: 
\b0 central copy of source on server\
In a centralized system, you work with change sets, number of changes that are to be treated as a whole\
\

\b Distributed: 
\b0 dev clones entire repository on local machine, does not require central repository (but there can be one - GitHub)\
\
3 States of GIT:\
Committed - stored in local database\
Modified -changed, not committed to local database\
Staged - tagged to be in clued in next commit snapshot\
\
3 Areas of GIT:\
Working directory\
\
Staging area (changes from local are staged before getting committed\
\
GIT Repo - repository controlled by GIT\
\
Remote repo GitHub (4th area)\
\

\b Command line
\b0  is the way to go.\
\
git config - configure the tooling\
git init - initial a git repo locally\
git clone - download a project from remote\
git add - prepare file to staging\
git commit - commits to local git repository\
\
